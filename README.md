# High-Scale Meters Implementation

![System Design Diagram](src\assets\flow.png)

## Features implemented
- Backend
  - In-memory dataset of ~15k meters
  - Endpoints:
    - GET /meters?limit=&cursor=&q=&status=&type=
    - GET /meters/changes?since=
    - GET /mock/meters.json (full dataset, excluding deleted)
    - GET /mock/changes.json?since=
  - CORS enabled
- Mobile app
  - Cache-first loading using IndexedDB
  - Debounced search (300ms) and combined filters
  - Infinite scroll (page size ~1000)
  - Pull-to-refresh applies /meters/changes
  - Smooth scrolling with OnPush + trackBy

## Run
### Backend
```
node backend/server.js
```

### Frontend
```
npm start
# or
ionic serve
```

## Architecture
- Data flow: API ‚Üí MetersApiService ‚Üí MetersStore (RxJS) ‚Üí HomePage UI
- Cursor-based pagination: opaque base64 cursor bound to filters via fingerprint
- Offline: cache-first from IndexedDB + stale-while-revalidate and changes feed

## Ethical AI usage
This implementation was assisted by an AI coding assistant
- Used AI for some boilerplate scaffolding (e.g., Angular service setup, RxJS patterns).
- Referred to AI for syntax reminders and code structure guidance.
- All AI-assisted snippets were reviewed, tested, and adapted to fit the project requirements.
- Final architecture and business logic decisions were made independently.
